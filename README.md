This project is a basic Node.js application that I made for my CS340 Final Project in Oregon State University's Ecampus CS program.
The following GitHub repo is primarily what I referenced in order to do this: https://github.com/wolfordj/CS340-Sample-Web-App.
Also, the lectures from CS340 and CS290 were a lot of help in understanding how Node.js works.
